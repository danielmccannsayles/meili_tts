It counts for society at large  because it represents a major conduit through which cultural  knowledge \ufb02ows from one generation to the next and beyond, and be- cause it is a means by which necessary goods are distributed to mem- bers of society.

The appreciation of family as a societal cornerstone is one reason  why the academic and public debate over \u201cfamily decline\u201d or \u201cfamily  change\u201d is so spirited and controversial.
